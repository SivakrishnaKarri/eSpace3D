	* Release 1.0.2
	* Bugfix release
	* Add .asmdef files to Piglet tree, so that advanced
	users have better control over their build config

	ChangeLog.txt [new]:
	* Move ChangeLog.txt to Assets/Piglet/Documentation, so
	that users can see it.

	GltfImporter:
	* Throw Piglet.JsonParseException instead of
	Newtonsoft.Json.JsonParseException on glTF parsing errors. This
	decouples Piglet applications from Json.NET, so that Piglet has
	the option to use other JSON parsing libraries in the future.

	UnityGLTF:
	* Replace GLTFSerialization.dll with C# source files, so that
	Piglet no longer depends on a specific version of
	Newtonsoft.Json.dll (10:0:0:0).  This allows users to resolve the
	multiple-copies-of-Json.NET problem by deleting Piglet's copy of
	Newtonsoft.Json.dll. It also gives users more convenient access to
	the glTF parsing code, for their own understanding/modification.
